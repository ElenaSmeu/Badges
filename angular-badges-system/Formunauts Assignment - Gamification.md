# Formunauts Assignment - Gamification

In our App we want to introduce a gamification feature. The main goal is to motivate fundraisers in their day to day work. 

Create a gamification library page implementing the following user stories.

1. As a fundraiser I want to see all available achievements.
2. As a fundraiser I want to distinguish between achievements that I've unlocked and achievements I've not unlocked.
3. As a fundraiser I want to see filter for unlocked achievements.
4. As a fundraiser I want to filter for achievements by a text search (by name and description)
5. As a fundraiser I want the last unlocked achievement to be highlighted.


An achievement (at least) consists of: 

- Name 
- Image/Icon 
- Description 
- Level/Difficulty 
- Times of being unlocked (some achievements can be unlocked multiple tiles)


### Evaluation criteria

To us it is important that the code is:
- clean
- readable
- maintainable
- performant


### Technical Background

- Please implement the assignment using Angular
- You can just mock an API to please your needs
- Please add a button to unlock a specific achievement for testing/demonstration purposes

### General Background

We don't expect you to spend days of work on this to create a ready-to-ship product.
The main goal of the assignment is to give our developers an insight on how you work. 
Once you have finished the assignment we will invite you to a second meeting where you can show us your work and we will ask you questions about your approach.
